The code is designed to analyze the Cleveland heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, aiming to identify key predictors of heart disease and provide actionable insights for early detection and prevention. It performs a comprehensive workflow that includes data preprocessing, statistical analysis, machine learning model training, and visualization. The preprocessing steps ensure that the raw dataset is cleaned and transformed into a usable format by handling missing values, converting data types, and preparing binary labels for classification tasks. Using logistic regression and an MLP classifier, the code builds predictive models to classify the presence of heart disease and evaluates their performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices. Additionally, it conducts statistical analysis with Pearson correlation to identify features most strongly associated with heart disease. Data visualizations, such as box plots and bar charts, are generated to explore relationships between top predictors and heart disease status. The overall purpose of the code is to utilize machine learning and statistical methods to assist medical professionals in diagnosing heart disease efficiently and improving public health outcomes through data-driven insights.
